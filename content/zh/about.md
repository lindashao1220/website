## Who am I?

Hello 你，我是邵彦瑞。 currently based in Shanghai. I am a web developer, creative designer, and student studying at NYUSH. I am interested in design because I believe creating an intuitive experience in the product is important. People are already on the day-to-day struggle a lot in their life, but being able to design the moment of eureka for people and allowing them to have a moment to clear their minds is what inspires my work.
