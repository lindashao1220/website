The stage becomes a symbolic canvas in this virtual body performance, reflecting the interconnectedness between human actions and the environment. The performer, embodying an avatar, takes the audience on a journey through the consequences of deforestation.

At the outset, the avatar, akin to a deity, embarks on a journey into a virtual forest, driven by curiosity. However, with each step, trees disappear gradually, a visual representation of the immediate impact of such actions on the environment. As the avatar reaches the end of the forest path, a poignant moment unfolds. The environment transforms, revealing a harrowing scene symbolizing human suffering â€“ tears and lifeless bodies within the trunks of trees. This portrayal emphasizes how humanity, in harming the trees, inadvertently inflicts harm upon itself.

The concluding scene features a large-headed baby with the deforestation scene reflected in its eyes, symbolizing the lasting imprint of our negative actions on nature. It serves as a powerful reminder that nature bears witness to our misdeeds, and there are consequences for our actions. Beneath the once-thriving forest, roots unveil a community of people with somber expressions, embodying the profound impact of deforestation on both the natural world and humanity. Meanwhile, the performer turns to the audience under the stage, questioning everyone present: Are we destroying our future with our own hands?

The performance unravels the hidden consequences of environmental degradation. Through this immersive experience, the performance aims to foster empathy, awareness, and a collective responsibility toward preserving our natural world.
