In the physical world, here and there are never the same. However, this website can be a space of encounter, a plaza where here and there converge. 

People can get on the website at the same time and take pictures of a part of their face by following the instruction. Ultimately, they can see a photo face collage of themselves and the other online users.

It can be opened [here](https://photocollage.glitch.me/).
