The Sugar Viewer is a prototype of a bubble tea ordering app that can visualize the total amount of sugar in a cup of bubble tea including toppings.

Nowadays, an increasing number of people prefer to drink milk tea, however, our drink is getting sweeter by adding ingredients in it. Through the investigation we have made, our group have concluded that there is an urgent need for an app to be developed to help people visualise the sugar content in the milk tea when ingredients are added, thus helping people to make choices, and below is the research result.

Frequence of drinking milk tea: ![Frequence of drinking milk tea](../img/frequency.png)

Concerning percentage of the sugar content in milk tea: ![Concerning percentage of the sugar content in milk tea](../img/percentage.png)

Have you ever ordered a new milk tea product when you donâ€™t know how much sugar content is appropriate? ![appropriate sugar content](../img/appropriate.png)

Have you ever thought that adding ingredients in your milk tea has a great influence on the sugar content? ![sugar influence](../img/influence.png)

Do you think it is necessary to launch an app to tell the sugar content before you drink milk tea? ![launch an app](../img/app.png)
