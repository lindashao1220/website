The Sugar Viewer is a prototype of a bubble tea ordering app that can visualize the total amount of sugar in a cup of bubble tea including toppings.

Nowadays, an increasing number of people prefer to drink milk tea, however, our drink is getting sweeter by adding ingredients in it. Through the investigation we have made, our group have concluded that there is an urgent need for an app to be developed to help people visualise the sugar content in the milk tea when ingredients are added, thus helping people to make choices, and below is the research result.

Frequence of drinking milk tea: ![Frequence of drinking milk tea](../img/frequency.png)

Concerning percentage of the sugar content in milk tea: ![Concerning percentage of the sugar content in milk tea](../img/percentage.png)

Have you ever ordered a new milk tea product when you donâ€™t know how much sugar content is appropriate? ![appropriate sugar content](../img/appropriate.png)

Have you ever thought that adding ingredients in your milk tea has a great influence on the sugar content? ![sugar influence](../img/influence.png)

Do you think it is necessary to launch an app to tell the sugar content before you drink milk tea? ![launch an app](../img/app.png)

The interface of most of the bubble tea ordering app is like this, and below is an example in Ele.me.

but, the question is what does â€˜ä¸‰åˆ†ç³–â€™ or â€˜å¾®ç³–â€™ mean? How sweet will the bubble tea be after toppings are selected? Therefore, We tried to develop this app for people who enjoy drinking milk tea and also for the bubble-tea stores. Below is our new version trying to help people keep sweetness in their control ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡

With this app, the users can know how sweet the drink will be, before they actually taste it, which can help users make choices easier.
